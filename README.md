### About The Project

Threadit is a comprehensive clone of the popular social media platform Reddit. This project focuses exclusively on the backend API, providing all the necessary endpoints to build a full-featured frontend application.

The primary goal was to create a real-world, portfolio-grade project demonstrating proficiency in:
*   Secure user authentication with JWT and email verification.
*   Complex database schema design with Mongoose.
*   RESTful API design and implementation.
*   Handling media uploads to a cloud service (Cloudinary).
*   Implementing core social media mechanics like communities, posts, nested comments, and voting.

### Key Features

-   **üë§ User Authentication & Management**
    -   Secure user registration with password hashing (`bcrypt`).
    -   Email verification via One-Time Password (OTP).
    -   JWT-based authentication using secure HTTP-only cookies.
    -   User login and logout.
    -   Ability to upload and update profile pictures.
    -   **Karma System**: User karma automatically updates based on upvotes/downvotes on their posts and comments.

-   **üè† Community Management**
    -   Create public or private communities (subreddits).
    -   Join public communities instantly.
    -   Request to join private communities, which can be approved by admins.
    -   Community owners have full administrative rights, including deleting the community and its content.

-   **üìù Post & Comment System**
    -   Create posts with a title, body, and optional media (images/videos).
    -   Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for posts and comments.
    -   Only post authors or community admins can edit/delete posts.
    -   Hierarchical commenting system.

-   **‚¨ÜÔ∏è Voting System**
    -   Upvote and downvote both posts and comments.
    -   The system intelligently handles vote changes: casting a new vote, removing an existing vote, or switching from an upvote to a downvote (and vice versa).

### Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or newer)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
*   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed and running locally, or a connection string to a cloud instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

#### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Adam556678/threadit.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd threadit
    ```

3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    -   Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project.
    -   Copy the contents of `.env.example` (or the block below) into your new `.env` file and fill in your own values.

    ```env
    # Server Configuration
    PORT=3000

    # MongoDB Connection
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

    # JWT Secret
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_for_jwt

    # Cloudinary Credentials for media uploads
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

    # Email Credentials for OTP verification (e.g., using nodemailer)
    EMAIL_HOST=your_smtp_host
    EMAIL_PORT=your_smtp_port
    EMAIL_USER=your_email_address
    EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
    ```

5.  **Start the server:**
    ```sh
